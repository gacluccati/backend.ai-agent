Fix a regression to spawning GPU sessions, by passing the original container distribution value (taken from image labels, e.g., `ubuntu16.04`) to compute plugins' `get_hooks()` method instead of the matched result (e.g., `static-gnu`) since the responsibility of choosing the optimal hook binary is on the plugin itself.
