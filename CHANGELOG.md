----------------------

### Breaking Changes
* - Now it runs on Python 3.8 or higher only.

### Features
* Now we support ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) accelerators via `backend.ai-accelerator-rocm` plugin.
* Now our manager-to-agent RPC uses [Callosum](https://github.com/lablup/callosum) instead of aiozmq, supporting Python 3.8 natively. ([#157](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/157))
* Support user-defined bootstrap script (e.g., this can be used to clone a git repo) ([#161](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/161))
* ResourceSlots are now more permissive. Agent still checks the validity of known slots but also allows zero-valued unknown slots as well. ([#162](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/162))
* All CLI commands are now accessible via `backend.ai ag` ([#165](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/165))
* Add support for pre-open service ports for user-written apps ([#167](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/167))
* Add a new "app" kernel-runner runtime type for GUI and application-only kernels ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Mark kernel started after bootstrap script is executed ([#190](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/190))
* Generalize kernel-runner volume lists using plugin-like krunner package auto-detection ([#198](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/198))

### Deprecations
* Using CentOS 6.10 as the base distribution for importing images is deprecated. ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))

### Fixes
* Detection for manager now works for HA setup seamlessly. (It now determines if at least one manager is running.) [lablup/backend.ai#125](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/125)
* Fix wrong ownership of .ssh and keypair files when the SSH keypair is set via the `internal_data` field of the kernel creation config.
* Make scratch directory accesses for setup/tear-down fully asynchronous ([#186](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/186))
* Fix service-port parsing routines to recognize "vnc-web" service ports for GUI containers ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Make the kernel runner's service parser consistent with documentation ([#197](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/197))
* Update test fixtures to work with pytest-asyncio 0.11 and use a separate registry state data file for each test sessions ([#208](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/208))
* Update test fixtures to work with pytest-asyncio 0.12 ([#209](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/209))
* Fix lifecycle-related code errors when handling results of batch-mode tasks ([#210](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/210))

### Miscellaneous
* Now the kernel-runner runs on the prebuilt Python 3.8 mounted inside containers. ([#189](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/189))
* Adopt [towncrier](https://github.com/twisted/towncrier) to manage changelogs. ([#196](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/196))
* Update flake8 to a prerelease version supporting Python 3.8 syntaxes ([#211](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-agent/issues/211))
